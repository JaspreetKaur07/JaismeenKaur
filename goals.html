        <h2>Personal and Professional Goals</h2>
        <h3>Down the Road:</h3>
        <p>After finishing school, I hope to land a job in banking, maybe in financial analysis or customer service. My goal is to help people manage their money and grow in my career at the same time.</p>
        
        <h3>Right Now:</h3>
        <p>My main focus is to complete my Business program at Fleming College. I’m excited to learn as much as I can about finance and customer service to get ready for a career in banking.</p>
        
        <h3>In the Near Future:</h3>
        <p>I want to gain some hands-on experience by finding an internship or part-time job in the banking sector. This will help me understand how things work in real life and allow me to put my skills into practice.</p>
        
        <h3>In the Long Run:</h3>
        <p>Eventually, I’d like to move into a leadership role in the banking industry. I want to be in a position where I can make important decisions and help others grow in their careers too.</p>
